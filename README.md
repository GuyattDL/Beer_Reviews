# Beer_Reviews
A project which mimics the TCB Analytics interview kit for hiring data scientists.

At the Strata Data Conference, 2017, Tanya Cashorali of TCB Analytics introduced the "One-Size-Fits-All Interivew Kit" which she and her employer used to hire and test for data skills.

A recording of the conference talk can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUDI8fkzSww

The 'interview kit' includes of a take home test comprised of four clear questions to be answered about a dataset. The dataset is 1.5m beer reviews from beeradvocate.com which can be found on kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews

The questions to be answered are:

1. Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?
2. If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
3. Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of the beer?
4. Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?

This project is my attempt at the test section of this interview kit as a way to sharpen my skills and demonstrate them to you, the reader.
